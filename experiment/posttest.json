      "question": "A modified Carey Foster's bridge shown in the figure is used for measurement of capacitance. Arm ab contains the secondary winding a mutual inductance of 18.35 mH and a total non reactive resistance of 200 Ω. The inductance of secondary of mutual inductor in arm ab is 40.6 mH .Arm ad is short circuited. Arm bc contains the unknown capacitor in series with a resistance of 119.5 Ω. Arm cd comprises of a resistor of 100 Ω resistance. Determine the capacitance and its equivalent series resistance.<br/><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"./image/quiz1.jpg\" style=\"width:460px;height:330px;\"></p>",
